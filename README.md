# MusicRecommendationSystem


[genres_v2.csv](https://github.com/AnitaSoroush/MusicRecommendationSystem/blob/main/genres_v2.csv), which is spotify's music database, is our song list based on which we are going to build our music recommender.


[musicRecommender.py](https://github.com/AnitaSoroush/MusicRecommendationSystem/blob/main/musicRecommender.py) is our main python code file. It takes the path to user preferences (a csv file) and outputs:
  * 5 csv files, each containing the top 5 songs for each user.Tracks from each playlist are sampled from the same cluster.
  * A single playlist file containing all the songs recommended to the users.


[input_tracks.csv](https://github.com/AnitaSoroush/MusicRecommendationSystem/blob/main/input_tracks.csv) is a sample of input file and [pl1.csv](https://github.com/AnitaSoroush/MusicRecommendationSystem/blob/main/pl1.csv), [pl2.csv](https://github.com/AnitaSoroush/MusicRecommendationSystem/blob/main/pl2.csv), [pl3.csv](https://github.com/AnitaSoroush/MusicRecommendationSystem/blob/main/pl3.csv), [pl4.csv](https://github.com/AnitaSoroush/MusicRecommendationSystem/blob/main/pl4.csv),  [pl5.csv](https://github.com/AnitaSoroush/MusicRecommendationSystem/blob/main/pl5.csv) and [single_playlist.csv](https://github.com/AnitaSoroush/MusicRecommendationSystem/blob/main/single_playlist.csv) are the outputs of the recommender based on this input file.
