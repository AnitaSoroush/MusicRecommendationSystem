# MusicRecommendationSystem

[genres_v2.csv](), which is spotify's music database, is our song list based on which we are going to build our music recommender.

[musicRecommender.py]() is our main python code file. It takes the path to user preferences (a csv file) and outputs:
* 5 csv files, each containing the top 5 songs for each user.Tracks from each playlist are sampled from the same cluster.
* A single playlist file containing all the songs recommended to the users.

[input_tracks.csv]() is a sample of input file and [](), [](), [](), [](), [](), []() are the outputs of the recommender based on this input file.

[report.pdf]() contains a complete explanation of the code and defferent parts of the project.
